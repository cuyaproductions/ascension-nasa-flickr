# Ascension App
## A NASA Flickr photo feed

First, I would like to say thanks to the IBM Design team for the opportunity to join the IBM Design family. I had a lot of fun working on this coding assignment and I look forward to any challenges presented to me as a potential IBM Design developer.

I used Backbone.js to create an MV\* architecture. This allowed me to iterate ideas quickly and take advantage of it's Events infrastructure. Backbone.js is also a nice to use for this simple application as it is a very transparent and flexible framework so debugging is a breeze for me.

Other tools I used included Sass and Autoprefixer implementing an Atomic/BEM structure, Webpack with Babel for ES6-syntax compiling, and few more packages for the build and serve process.


## Installing and Running

To build or serve this application, you need the latest version of stable Node.js and NPM.

1. Install packages

````
    $ npm install
````

2. To serve

````
		$ npm start
````

3. Or to build

````
	$ npm run build
````

This process will generate an `app/` directory that is used by the application.


## Improvements

My goal for the weekend was to develop a minimum viable product to showcase my skills and expertise. I focused on delivering a functioning application as well as optimizations on performance, aesthetics, and user experience. I created some [issues](https://github.com/cuyaproductions/ascension-nasa-flickr/issues) to show enhancements that I would have liked to make with more time.

## Thank you!

Enjoy!
